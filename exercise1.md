A small team of 6 people is developing an application in Java. Since it's about to be released, it would be advisable to take advantage of the different available tools for streamlining the process of continuous integration.

Firstly, for the linting phase of the CI process the chosen IDE (Eclipse, NetBeans...) provides basic linting capabilities, such as detection of syntax errors, unused variables or use of deprecated functions. For more advanced linting features, one of the available aids is [Checkstyle](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/). This tool specializes in static code analysis, detecting problematic class design patterns or enforcing a specific code convention.
Secondly, one of the most popular tools related to the testing phase is [JUnit](https://junit.org/). This framework allows us to apply unit testing to our Java code, as well as easing a test driven development enviroment by the automatization of unit tests. We can even use other tools in tandem such as [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/), a mocking platform most useful when our Java classes grow in complexity.

In conclusion, going back to the project specifications, a cloud-based CI solution is the most sensible choice. The team is small (6 people), so it should be a equally small or medium sized project. Also, it is reasonable to expect that such a project wouldn't demand much hardware use, so the pricing part doesn't have to be a problem. Lastly, it was stated that the project is in active development and about to be released, so the idea of allocating resources to set up a self-hosted CI enviroment in the current development stage is not the best option.
